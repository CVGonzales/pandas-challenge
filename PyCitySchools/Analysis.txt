Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

1. Students from Independent schools appear to perform slightly better than students from Government schools.
They also have a significantly higher overall passing rate. 
The reason for this could be that Independent schools employ better teachers than Government schools. 

2. There is an interesting trend which tells us that the smaller the school size, the better the students will perform.
As school sizes increase, it appears the the overall passing rate of students will decrease. 
The reason for this could be that smaller class sizes may be more beneficial for a student's learning.
